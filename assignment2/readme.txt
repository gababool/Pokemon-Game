At first we started off by sitting together with our laptops, using the LiveShare feature to go over how we 
wanted the overall design to look, for example what classes that we needed, methods and figuring out
different responsibilities. We created the appropriate classes and (empty) methods together to make a sort of "skeleton" for how to finished product was going to look and function. After this, we split up the rest of the work, but we did of course help eachother out when needed.

In this assignment compared to the last, we mostly had to split the work up more by methods, other than a single member being responsible for an entire class. Some methods we did figure out and write together in school.

Love:
- Mainly responsible for the TypeEffectiveness class, especially calculateMultiplier and the methods within. (Task 4)
- Created half of the methods in ItemBag, including addItem() and the methods used within. (Task 7)
- Responsible for making the equals() methods work in the classes that needed them, except Item (Task 1+2)

Emma:
- Did most of the Item class as well as methods in Pokemon that item uses, for example heal() and useItem() 
(Task 6)
- Made Enums work for Pokemon types (in PokemonType), which were then used in the TypeEffectiveness class.
(Task 4)
- Made the toString() method work in the classes that needed them. (Task 1+2+6)

Martin:
- Created the other half of the methods in ItemBag. (Task 7)
- Mainly responsible for many Pokemon methods, including attack(), receiveDamage() and spendEP(). (Task 1)
- Responsible for the Skill class and how it integrates with Pokemon. (Task 2)
