At first we started off by sitting together with our laptops, using the LiveShare feature in VSCode to go over how we wanted the overall design to look, for example what classes that we needed, methods and figuring out
different class responsibilities. We created the appropriate classes and method signatures together to make a sort of "skeleton" for how to finished product was going to look and function. This is how we created most of the constructors, variables and attributes for the different classes.

We want to emphasise that we did do much of this assignment together, as in sitting by the same table and coming up with ideas on how to write our code, even though one of us was obviously writing it at a time. This being said, each of us did have more or less involvement in the different classes even though we often helped each other out when needed and made contributions to other members tasks. Specified below is roughly how the tasks were divided:

Love:
- Responsible for the TypeEffectiveness class and its methods (Task 4)
- Responsible for the ItemBag class and its methods (Task 7)
- Responsible for making the equals() methods work in the classes that needed them, except Item (Task 1+2)

Emma:
- Responsible for the Item class as well as methods in Pokemon that Item uses, for example heal() and useItem() 
(Task 6)
- Responsible for PokemonType enum and made enums constants work in our program which are used in in the TypeEffectiveness and Pokemon classes.
(Task 4)
- Made the toString() methods work in the classes that needed them. (Task 1+2+6)

Martin:
- Mainly responsible for many of the Pokemon methods, including attack(), receiveDamage(), spendEP(). (Task 1+3+5)
- Responsible for the Skill class and how useSkill() it integrates with Pokemon's attack(). (Task 2)
